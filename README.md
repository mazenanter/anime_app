## üèõ Design & Architecture

### 1. Clean Architecture
The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles with clear separation of layers:

- **Data Layer:** Handles API calls, local storage, and models.
- **Domain Layer:** Contains entities, use cases, and business logic.
- **Presentation Layer:** Screens, widgets, and Cubits for state management.

This ensures **scalability** and **maintainability**.

### 2. State Management
- Uses **Cubit** from **Bloc** for reactive state updates.
- Localized language support using a Cubit for changing languages dynamically.
- UI listens to state changes and updates instantly without unnecessary rebuilds.

### 3. Folder Organization
